MANDATORY: Before creating any new component, service, or utility, follow the "Shared-First Development Principle":

DECISION QUESTIONS:
1. "Will this be used by 2+ apps?" → shared/ folder
2. "Is this business logic or data access?" → shared/ folder  
3. "Is this a reusable UI component?" → shared/ folder
4. "Is this app-specific routing/navigation?" → src/ folder

DECISION MATRIX:
- Components: ✅ Shared (Button, FormInput, Modal, Table) | ❌ App-specific (Navigation, AppHeader)
- Services: ✅ Shared (Database, API, Auth) | ❌ App-specific (routing)
- Utils: ✅ Shared (Formatting, validation, storage) | ❌ App-specific (config, constants)
- Types: ✅ Shared (Business models like Restaurant, Booking) | ❌ App-specific (Component props, app state)

WORKFLOW: New Component → Ask "Reusable by 2+ apps?" → Yes = shared/components/ | No = src/components/

NAMING: Shared = Generic names (Button, Modal) | App-specific = Prefixed names (ConsumerNavigation, PartnerHeader)

STYLING: Shared components must be theme-able with props (theme="blue|red|gray"). Always export from shared/components/index.ts

When in doubt, start in shared/ and move to app-specific only if truly unique.
