# LocalPlus Curated Pipeline - Deployment Checklist

## üóÉÔ∏è Step 1: Deploy Database Schema

### Prerequisites
- Supabase project with admin access
- PostgreSQL access via Supabase SQL editor

### Instructions
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Navigate to "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

2. **Execute Schema**
   - Create new query
   - Copy entire contents of `src/database/curated-pipeline-schema.sql`
   - Execute the schema (this will create all pipeline tables and functions)

3. **Verify Installation**
   Run this verification query:
   ```sql
   -- Verify all pipeline tables exist
   SELECT table_name 
   FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN (
     'suggested_businesses', 
     'sales_leads', 
     'discovery_campaigns', 
     'curation_activities', 
     'business_metrics'
   );
   
   -- Should return 5 rows
   ```

4. **Test Functions**
   ```sql
   -- Test quality score calculation
   SELECT calculate_quality_score(4.5, 120, true, true, true, 8);
   -- Should return a score around 85-90
   ```

### ‚úÖ Completion Criteria
- [ ] All 5 new tables created successfully
- [ ] Enhanced businesses table with new columns
- [ ] PostgreSQL functions working (approve_suggested_business, etc.)
- [ ] Indexes created for performance

   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variable**
   Update your `.env` file:
   ```env

     const response = await fetch(
       `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?` +
       `location=12.5664,99.9589&radius=5000&type=restaurant&` +

    target_location: "Hua Hin, Thailand",
    center_latitude: 12.5664,
    center_longitude: 99.9589,

    target_categories: ["Restaurants"],
    quality_filters: {
      minRating: 4.0,
      minReviewCount: 20,
      excludedTypes: ["fast_food", "gas_station"]

## üìà Step 5: Launch Sales Process Integration

### CRM Integration Points

   ```sql
   -- Query to export sales leads for CRM
   SELECT 
     sl.id,
     sl.priority_level,
     sl.estimated_partnership_value,
     sl.outreach_status,
     COALESCE(sb.name, b.name) as business_name,
     COALESCE(sb.phone, b.phone) as phone,
     COALESCE(sb.address, b.address) as address,
     COALESCE(sb.google_rating, b.google_rating) as rating,
     sl.created_at
   FROM sales_leads sl
   LEFT JOIN suggested_businesses sb ON sl.suggested_business_id = sb.id  
   LEFT JOIN businesses b ON sl.business_id = b.id
   WHERE sl.outreach_status = 'new'
   ORDER BY sl.priority_level DESC, sl.created_at;
   ```

2. **Partnership Value Calculator**
   ```typescript
   const calculatePartnershipValue = (business: any) => {
     let baseValue = 500; // Base monthly partnership fee
     
     // Rating multiplier
     if (business.rating >= 4.5) baseValue *= 1.5;
     else if (business.rating >= 4.0) baseValue *= 1.2;
     
     // Review volume multiplier  
     if (business.reviewCount >= 100) baseValue *= 1.3;
     else if (business.reviewCount >= 50) baseValue *= 1.1;
     
     // Category multipliers
     const categoryMultipliers = {
       'Restaurants': 1.2,
       'Wellness': 1.4,
       'Entertainment': 1.1,
       'Travel': 1.3
     };
     
     return Math.round(baseValue * (categoryMultipliers[business.category] || 1.0));
   };
   ```
